transcript_ato_case_3,"The fraudster gained unauthorised access to the customer's credit card account through a credential stuffing attack, using login credentials compromised in a separate third-party data breach. They then requested a new credit card for delivery to a 'mule address', likely authorising this with a generated One-Time Passcode, intending to intercept and activate it for fraudulent transactions.",CustomerFirstDigitalCodeAccessIndicator,"A binary indicator set to 1 if the current 'digital_code' (representing the access channel or device identifier) has never been seen before for this specific customer, and 0 otherwise. This flags the very first instance of access through a previously unobserved digital channel, indicating potential unauthorized access.","digital_code,event_date,event_time","The fraudster used credential stuffing to gain unauthorised access, likely from a new device or digital channel. If the fraud detection system primarily monitors transaction behavior, this initial anomalous access via an unfamiliar digital fingerprint would be missed. This feature explicitly flags first-time digital channel access, especially when preceding sensitive account actions like card requests, directly addressing the 'unauthorised access' part of the MO.",0.8,"The fraudster gained unauthorised access to the customer's credit card account through a credential stuffing attack, using login credentials compromised in a separate third-party data breach. They then requested a new credit card for delivery to a 'mule address', likely authorising this with a generated One-Time Passcode, intending to intercept and activate it for fraudulent transactions."

They then requested a new credit card for delivery to a 'mule address', likely authorising this with a generated One-Time Passcode, intending to intercept and activate it for fraudulent transactions.",DaysSinceLastCreditCardIssuance,"Calculates the number of days since the last credit card (primary or replacement) was issued to the customer. A very low value (e.g., 0-7 days) indicates a recent card issuance, which can be an anomaly if the customer rarely requests new cards, or if it's a second request in an unusually short period.","event_date,event_time","The core of this ATO is the request for a new credit card to a 'mule address'. If fraud detection focuses solely on transactional data, this crucial pre-transactional account modification event is missed. This feature flags recent card issuances, particularly those that deviate from a customer's normal account activity, helping to identify the fraudulent card request before the card is even delivered or used, thus preventing the 'mule address' delivery.",0.8,"The fraudster gained unauthorised access to the customer's credit card account through a credential stuffing attack, using login credentials compromised in a separate third-party data breach.

This score considers factors like 'transaction_amt' (unusually high/low), 'mcc' (unusual merchant categories), 'merchant_cntry_code' (new countries), 'cnp_flag' (higher card-not-present activity than usual), even if 'secure_flag' is true.","transaction_amt,mcc,cnp_flag,secure_flag,merchant_name,merchant_id,merchant_state_code,merchant_cntry_code,transaction_date,transaction_time,event_date,event_time","The fraudster's ultimate goal is to make fraudulent transactions with the new card. Even if the card request was authorized (potentially via a compromised OTP), the subsequent spending patterns on the newly activated card are likely to be anomalous compared to the legitimate customer's history. This feature specifically targets these early spending deviations, even if transactions appear 'secure' (e.g., 3D Secure), to catch the fraud before significant losses occur, addressing the 'intending to intercept and activate it for fraudulent transactions' part of the MO.",0.9,"The fraudster gained unauthorised access to the customer's credit card account through a credential stuffing attack, using login credentials compromised in a separate third-party data breach.
