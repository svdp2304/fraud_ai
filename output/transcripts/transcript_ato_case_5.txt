A: Thank you for calling SwiftBank Fraud Prevention. My name is Sarah, how can I help you today?
C: Hello Sarah. I'm calling about my credit card. I've just checked my online banking and I'm seeing some really strange activity. I'm feeling quite anxious about it, to be honest.
A: I understand your concern, Mr. Miller. I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this. First, for security, could you please confirm your full name, date of birth, and the first line of your address?
C: David Miller, 15th February 1975, 24 Elm Close, Leeds.
A: Thank you, Mr. Miller. And just to confirm, what is your sort code and account number for your main current account with us?
C: Oh, I'm calling about my credit card, not my current account. But it's 11-22-33 and 12345678.
A: Thank you for that, Mr. Miller. I've accessed your credit card account now. You mentioned unusual transactions. Could you please describe what you're seeing?
C: Well, there are a few really big ones. Like, one for £2,500 at 'Global Gadgets Online' and another for £1,800 at 'Luxury Lifestyle UK'. And then a cash advance for £1,000. I definitely didn't make any of these. And also, my credit limit seems to have gone up significantly, which I didn't ask for at all.
A: I see. That is certainly concerning. To help me investigate, can you tell me when you last logged into your online banking yourself, before you noticed these transactions?
C: Hmm, I think it was... maybe two days ago? Or three? I'm not entirely sure. I've been getting some really weird text messages lately, supposedly from SwiftBank, asking me to 'verify activity'. I clicked on one of them last week, I think. It looked very real.
A: Thank you for that information, Mr. Miller. That's a crucial detail. Have you, at any point, shared your online banking login details, your PIN, or any one-time passcodes with anyone, or entered them into a link from one of these suspicious texts or emails?
C: No, never shared them directly. But like I said, I did click a link in a text message that looked like it was from SwiftBank. It asked me to log in to 'secure my account'. I put my details in there. Oh dear, was that a mistake?
A: It sounds like it might have been, Mr. Miller. That's a common tactic used by fraudsters to gain access to accounts. When you accessed your online banking to check these transactions just now, what device were you using? Your phone, a laptop, or something else?
C: My laptop, like I always do.
A: And have you noticed any other unusual activity on your laptop, or perhaps your phone, since you clicked that link?
C: Not really, no. Just these dodgy texts.
A: Okay. Mr. Miller, based on what you've described – the suspicious texts, clicking a link and entering your details, the unauthorized credit limit increase, and the large purchases and cash advance – it strongly indicates that your online banking credentials may have been compromised through a phishing or malware attack, likely a keylogger. This is where fraudsters steal your login details after you inadvertently download something malicious.
C: So someone else has been in my account? Oh, this is terrible!
A: I understand this is distressing. We need to act quickly. I'm going to immediately block your credit card to prevent any further unauthorized activity. I will also raise a full fraud case for you. We will investigate all these transactions and the credit limit increase. For your protection, we'll also reset your online banking password. I'd strongly advise you to run a full scan on your laptop with reputable anti-virus software and avoid logging into any banking sites from that device until you're sure it's clean.
C: What about the money? Will I get it back?
A: We will investigate thoroughly, Mr. Miller. As per UK Finance guidelines, if it's confirmed you were a victim of unauthorized fraud and you haven't acted fraudulently or with gross negligence, you should be reimbursed. We'll keep you updated on the progress of your case. You'll receive a new card in the post within 3-5 working days. I'll also send you an email with some advice on how to protect yourself from future scams.
C: Thank you, Sarah. That's a relief.
A: You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this today?
C: No, I think that's all for now. Just get that card stopped, please.
A: Absolutely, Mr. Miller. Your card is now blocked and the fraud case has been initiated. You'll receive a reference number via SMS shortly. Please keep that safe. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to call us back on this number.
C: Will do. Thanks, Sarah.
A: Thank you for calling SwiftBank and please take care. Goodbye.
C: Goodbye.
